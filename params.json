{"name":"Prefixr Ant Task","body":"# What is this?\r\n\r\nThis project is the creation of an Apache Ant task for use of the [Prefixr API](http://prefixr.com/). It will \r\nallow developers to make use of css3 styles and replace these with the correct prefix at build/deploy time.\r\n\r\nIt will allow for a user to set multiple filesets to be scanned for css content and call the Prefixr Api to prefix \r\nthe CSS3 styles with the cross browser spesific styles.\r\n\r\nFor example a css file containing the following styles\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.class {\r\n  border-radius: 5px;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be converted to \r\n\r\n```css\r\n.class{\r\n  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 5px;\r\n  border-radius: 5px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# How do I use it?\r\n\r\nThe task allows for an the user to either override the current css file or to use a suffix at the end of the file. \r\n\r\nI have included a example build file to use the ANT task at in the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/1895209).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to use the task you can either clone this directory and build the JAR yourself or use the pre-built jar available from this repository's [download section](https://github.com/jaconel/PrefixrAntTask/downloads).\r\n\r\nEnsure that the JAR is available some where on your class path and add the following to the top of your build file \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<taskdef name=\"prefixr\" classname=\"org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.Prefixr\" classpath=\"Prefixr.jar\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nonce this has been done, you can use the task def in any of your targets in the following way\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<prefixr override=\"false\" suffix=\"out\">\r\n  <fileset dir=\"/path/to/css/folder\" includes=\"**/*.css\" />\r\n</prefixr>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the override option is set to true, the suffix option will be ignored and your current css files will be overriden with the results received from prefixr.\r\n\r\nIf the override option is set to false a suffix is required. The suffix will be used when creating a new file to save your css to. For example, the above code\r\nwill save the results for a file named styles.css to styles.out.css. This option is usefull if you do not wish to override your current css.\r\n\r\nFor more information on using Filesets, please refer to the [Apache documentation](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html).\r\n\r\n# What if I find an issues\r\n\r\nIf you find any issue or have suggestion to improve the tool, please feel free to contribute, log an issue or contact me on twitter [jaco_nel007](https://twitter.com/jaco_nel007).\r\n    ","tagline":"An Ant task that makes use of Prefixr API for converting CSS3 attributes to the corresponding vendor specific syntax","google":"UA-30742007-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
